Looking for some inspiration?

## Tools
- [Sketch.js](https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js), the original inspiration for Sandpit, by [soulwire](https://soulwire.co.uk/)

## Generative art
Basically everything at [Inconvergent](http://inconvergent.net/) is incredible, but specifically Anders' essays on [Generative Algorithms](http://inconvergent.net/generative/) and [Shepherding Random Numbers](http://inconvergent.net/shepherding-random-numbers/) are must read. His twitter, [@inconvergent](https://twitter.com/inconvergent), is also full of great examples and musings.
