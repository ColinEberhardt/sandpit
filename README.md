Early concept for a creative coding sandpit thingy, inspired by [sketch.js](https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), because it makes ES6 really easy. The library itself doesn't need it though.
